Max Grossman - Software Development LifeCycle
The term “Software Development Life Cycle” dates back to the 1950s.
At that time, there weren’t any other methods or frameworks available.
There was only one method described as the Software Development Life Cycle — “develop large-scale functional business systems in an age of large-scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines.”
Today, the definition of the software development life cycle is the following:
Build high-quality software in the least possible time by following the 7 phases of the software development life cycle.
Now, there are various SDLC methodologies, Waterfall being the oldest and most popular one dating back to the 1960s.
