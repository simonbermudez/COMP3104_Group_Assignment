DevOps culture brings the cohesion of autonomous teams to fast paced, high-demanding environments. 
It has a set of processes that when applied correctly can:
1. Drastically reduce IT overhead
2. Remove manual tasks both of a mundane or complex nature
3. Enforce best security practices
4. Expedite product delivery
5. Improve communication and collaboration across teams


Since a DevOps engineer wouldn’t be responsible for developing a product, we won’t be working in the product development domain. Given this, we will be starting with a working web application. After the pre-requisites are installed during our lab, we’ll look under the hood of the application that we’ve been given to get Continuously Integrated and Continuously Deployed (CI/CD).
